# JavaFXGame
Normally use a readMe as a document to keep track of what I need to do/doing during project.

Will now use to share point of project I guess

After my Scheduling Project I felt I had a good understanding of JavaFX, and wanted a project
where I could continue practicing JavaFX, and reaffirm my learning, with a project that I didnt
need to stop and learn how to do every new thing. That said alot of new things were practiced here
mainly ScheduledEvents and tasks. Learning how to run something simulatinously in the background
was a big worry going into this task, and I am proud of how easily I felt I learned it. Another
subject practiced was just GUI design. In my Scheduling Project the GUI is very basic, with
enough colors and CSS to make it look a bit better. For this project I handcreated assets and art
to use inside the project, and tried to work towards a more cohesive GUI. Coding wise the code is far
from Clean Coding, and could definetly use an hour or so of clean up. Unsure if it will happen.
